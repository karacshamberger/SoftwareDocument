# SoftwareDocument
•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
o	The gaming room client created a mobile game that was inspired by a popular tv game back in the day. The customer wanted the game to be available over multiple operating systems. The Gaming Room was required to have only one instance of each game at a time with multiple players who earned points by answering questions correctly.
•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
o	During this document I thought I did really well will the requirements section. I thought I explained each operating system well and what provided a correct answer that the customer would like and benefit from.
•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
o	Using the design document, I thought it was extremely helpful when developing code. By using the document, it helped you understand the requirements and work through your code to meet the requirements. 
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
o	Design constraints is something I would like to revise. After doing further research and the professors comments I have a greater understanding and what goes into design constraints.
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
o	Incorporating the user’s needs is what they are paying you for. If you develop something that they do not want they will not be happy with the end product. Building off the user requirements is the best practice and will provide the best product for the user.
